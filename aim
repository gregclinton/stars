telescope perpendicular to axis
axis approximately east west
axis horizontal (use thread plumb line)
axis accurately east west (telescope north south when horizontal -- use star near horizon)
all angles must be within 0.05 degrees (about 1 mm over 1 m) so target appears in middle tenth of half degree field
get target star or galaxy ra and dec J2000 coordinates from wikipedia
adjust J2000 coordinates using precession calculator
at precessed ra local sidereal time, spin telescope near precessed dec and visually scan for target
